# Cross-Validation Project

## Overview

**Cross-validation** is a model evaluation technique used to assess how a machine learning model will generalize to an independent dataset. It helps prevent **overfitting** and ensures that the model performs well on unseen data by splitting the dataset into multiple parts and training/testing the model on different subsets.

## What is Cross-Validation?

Cross-validation involves dividing the data into several subsets (called "folds"), training the model on some of them, and testing it on the remaining ones. The most commonly used method is **k-fold cross-validation**, where the dataset is divided into **k** equal parts, and the process is repeated **k** times, each time with a different test fold.

## Benefits
- More reliable estimate of model performance
- Reduces bias and variance in evaluation
- Helps in hyperparameter tuning and model selection
- Works with both classification and regression tasks
