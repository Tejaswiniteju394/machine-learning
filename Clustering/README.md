# Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that involves grouping a set of objects or data points into clusters, such that:
- Objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
- Objects in different clusters are less similar or more distinct.
The goal is to find natural groupings or patterns in data without predefined labels.

# Digit Clustering using Unsupervised Learning

This project explores **digit clustering** using unsupervised learning techniques such as **K-Means**. The objective is to group handwritten digit images (e.g., from the MNIST dataset) into clusters without using labeled data.

## üìù Project Description

This notebook includes:

- Loading and visualizing handwritten digit images
- Preprocessing steps (flattening, normalization)
- Applying clustering algorithms
- Evaluating clusters using visualization or comparison with true labels (if available)
- Plotting cluster centroids and examples
