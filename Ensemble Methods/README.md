# Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods are a set of machine learning techniques that combine the predictions from multiple individual models (called base learners) to produce a stronger, more accurate, and more robust overall model.

# Ensemble Methods Project
## Overview
This project explores **Ensemble Methods** in machine learning, which combine multiple models to improve overall predictive performance. By aggregating the predictions of several base learners, ensemble methods often achieve better accuracy and robustness than individual models.

## What are Ensemble Methods?
Ensemble methods create a group of models (called base learners) and combine their predictions through techniques such as voting or averaging. Common types include:
- **Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating) — e.g., Random Forest
- **Boosting** — e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost
- **Stacking** — combining multiple model predictions with a meta-model

## Features
- Implementation of popular ensemble algorithms
- Improved model accuracy and stability
- Handles overfitting and variance issues
- Supports both classification and regression tasks

## How It Works
- Multiple base models are trained on different subsets or weighted samples of data.
- Predictions from these models are aggregated (majority vote, weighted average, or meta-model).
- Ensemble leverages the diversity of models to reduce errors and bias.
