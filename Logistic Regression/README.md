# Logistic Regression Project

## Overview

**Logistic Regression** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used primarily for **binary classification** tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the **logistic (sigmoid) function**. Despite its name, logistic regression is a **classification** algorithm, not a regression one.

## What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic regression estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific category. It outputs values between 0 and 1, which are then mapped to discrete classes using a threshold (commonly 0.5). It works well when the relationship between features and the output is approximately **linear**.

## Features
- Suitable for binary and multi-class classification
- Outputs probabilities for class membership
- Simple, interpretable, and efficient
- Can be extended with regularization (L1, L2)
