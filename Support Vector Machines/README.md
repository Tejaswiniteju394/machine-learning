# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Project

## Overview

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is versatile thanks to kernel functions that allow it to handle non-linearly separable data.

## Features
- Performs both classification and regression.
- Uses kernel trick to handle non-linear data.
- Maximizes margin between classes for better generalization.
- Robust to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

## How SVM Works
- SVM identifies the hyperplane that best divides the dataset into classes.
- The "support vectors" are the data points closest to the hyperplane and influence its position.
- Different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function) allow SVM to handle complex datasets.
