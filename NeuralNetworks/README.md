## 📝 Project Description

This notebook performs the following tasks:

- Loads a dataset of handwritten digits.
- Preprocesses the data (e.g., normalization, reshaping).
- Creates a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Trains the model with labeled data.
- Evaluates the model on test data.
- Visualizes predictions and performance metrics.
